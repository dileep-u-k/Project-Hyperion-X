> **The Operating System for AGI at Planetary Scale.**

---

## The Mission

The current landscape of large-scale AI is defined by a fragmented and inefficient scramble for compute. Teams wrestle with heterogeneous hardware across multiple clouds and on-premise data centers, leading to spiraling costs, crippling complexity, and wasted resources. Brute-force scaling is no longer a viable strategy.

**Project Hyperion-X** is the answer. It is an intelligent, self-optimizing control plane designed to unify the world's compute resources into a single, cohesive fabric. By leveraging reinforcement learning, Hyperion-X acts as an autonomous nervous system for AI infrastructure, making real-time decisions to route workloads to the most optimal location based on cost, latency, performance, and even the carbon footprint of the underlying power grid.

This project is building the foundational infrastructure required to run AGI-level workloads reliably and efficiently at a planetary scale.

## ✨ Core Features

-   🧠 **Autonomous RL-driven Orchestration:** A multi-objective reinforcement learning agent acts as the global scheduler, learning and adapting to optimize for cost, speed, and sustainability without human intervention.
-   🌍 **Planetary-Scale Hybrid Cloud:** Seamlessly manages and schedules jobs across a heterogeneous fleet of nodes spanning **AWS, GCP, Azure, on-premise HPC clusters, and edge devices**.
-   ⚡️ **Ultra-Low-Latency Preemption:** Guarantees **sub-50ms execution** for high-priority inference workloads by dynamically and intelligently pausing, checkpointing, and migrating lower-priority batch training jobs.
-   🌿 **Carbon-Aware Scheduling:** Integrates with real-time grid carbon intensity data to prioritize running workloads on renewable energy, reducing the environmental impact of large-scale AI.
-   🛡️ **Resilience & Self-Healing:** Designed to be fault-tolerant from the ground up, automatically recovering from node failures, network partitions, and even entire cloud region outages.

## 🏛️ Architecture at a Glance

Hyperion-X is built on a three-tiered architecture: the global **Federation Plane** (the brain), the regional **Cluster Plane** (the manager), and the on-machine **Node Plane** (the agent).

# Project Hyperion-X: Architectural Blueprint v0.1

**Author:** Dileep Karehuchhannanavar  
**Last Updated:** August 2025  
**Status:** DRAFT

## 1. Vision & Goals

### 1.1 Vision
Hyperion-X aspires to become the **planetary-scale operating system for AI** — a self-learning, autonomous orchestration platform capable of scheduling and managing **distributed AI training and inference workloads** across heterogeneous infrastructure (multi-cloud, on-prem, and edge).  

This is not merely a scheduler. It is the **control plane for AGI-level compute**, designed to operate at global scale, under adversarial conditions, with dynamic optimization for cost, latency, reliability, and sustainability.

### 1.2 Core Goals
- **Autonomous Orchestration:** Dynamically schedule workloads across **AWS, GCP, Azure, and edge nodes** with no manual intervention.  
- **Optimization via RL:** Leverage a **multi-objective Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent** to optimize for:  
  - Compute cost (spot pricing, reserved instances)  
  - Latency (cross-region/cross-cloud traffic)  
  - Data egress charges  
  - Carbon intensity of grids (sustainability-aware scheduling)  
- **Resilience & Self-Healing:** Ensure workloads continue under **node failures, preemptions, or network partitions**.  
- **Latency Guarantees:** Deliver **sub-50ms preemption** for inference workloads by dynamically pausing/rescheduling batch jobs.  
- **Developer Simplicity:** Expose a **clean API** (via gRPC/REST) where a user submits a job spec (PyTorch, JAX, or custom container) and the system “just runs it” at optimal placement.

### 1.3 Non-Goals
- Not a new container runtime. Hyperion-X builds on **Docker/CRI-O** and runs on **Kubernetes** clusters.  
- Not a new ML framework. It orchestrates jobs from **PyTorch, JAX, DeepSpeed, vLLM**, etc.  
- Not a pure HPC batch system replacement — it **integrates with Slurm/MPI** when required.
